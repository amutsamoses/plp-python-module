# Basic Calculator Program

## Week 1 Python Module

**Objective**: In this project, I be will demonstrating my understanding of Python variables, data types, and basic operations.

- Variables
- Data types (floats, strings)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Input and output
- Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Function definitions

---

## Description

The **Basic Calculator Program** is a simple Python project I created. This program allows users to:

- Input two numbers.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- View the result of the operation in a clear and user-friendly format.

This project highlights the foundational concepts of Python programming that I learned during this module.

## Features

- Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values or division by zero).
- Provides a clear and intuitive interface for users.
- Showcases my knowledge of Python variables, data types, and arithmetic operations.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `basic_calculator.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `basic_calculator.py`.
4. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python basic_calculator.py
   ```

## iutput

- Enter the first number: 10
- Enter the second number: 5
- Enter the operation (+, -, \*, /): +

## Output

- 10 + 5 = 15
